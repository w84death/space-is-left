## üéÆ Game Concept

In Space is Left, you control a futuristic line rider that continuously moves forward through space. The core challenge: you can only turn left, making navigation a strategic puzzle. Choose between Easy mode for a relaxed experience or Hardcore mode where everything moves at 4x speed! Collect energy to survive, grab powerups to enhance your abilities, and see how long you can last in the infinite void of space!

- **89% Pixel Reduction**: Processes only 230,400 pixels instead of 2+ million at 1080p
- **Retro Aesthetic**: Authentic pixelated look with nearest-neighbor scaling
- **Toggle with F1**: Switch between internal and native resolution anytime

### Visual Effects
- **CRT Scanlines**: Press F2 to enable authentic CRT monitor effect
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Automatic fullscreen with letterboxing for correct aspect ratio
- **Smart Scaling**: Mouse input automatically scaled to match internal resolution

### Performance Benefits
- ‚úÖ 100-200% FPS improvement on most hardware
- ‚úÖ Runs smoothly on older/weaker GPUs
- ‚úÖ Lower power consumption for laptops
- ‚úÖ Reduced GPU memory usage (921KB vs 8.3MB)

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

### The Left-Turn Challenge
The core mechanic is simple but creates complex gameplay:
- You can only turn left, no right turns allowed
- This forces you to think ahead and plan circular routes
- Complete full rotations (360¬∞) for bonus points
- The more loops you complete, the higher the bonus multiplier

### Energy System
- Energy constantly drains over time
- Collect energy powerups to survive
- Each energy pickup grows your line longer
- Run out of energy = game over

### Collision Rules
- You can safely overlap your first 3 segments
- Collision with segments 4+ results in game over (unless shielded)
- Arena boundaries wrap around (you teleport to the opposite side)

### Scoring
- Points over time for surviving
- Bonus points for collecting powerups
- Multiplier bonus for completing full circles
- Separate high score tracking for each difficulty level
- Hardcore mode provides the ultimate challenge with 4x speed!

## üöÄ Tips & Strategies

1. **Plan Your Circles**: Since you can only turn left, plan circular paths to collect powerups efficiently
2. **Use Arena Wrapping**: Hit the boundaries to teleport and create new paths
3. **Manage Your Length**: Sometimes being shorter is advantageous - grab shrink powerups strategically
4. **Complete Loops**: Full rotations give significant score bonuses
5. **Shield Timing**: Save shields for when you're long and navigating tight spaces
6. **Speed Control**: Use speed boosts to quickly grab distant powerups
7. **Time Manipulation**: Slow time helps with precise navigation

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Adding New Features
The modular engine design makes it easy to extend:

1. **New Powerups**: Add to `PowerupType` enum and implement in `CollectPowerup()`
2. **Visual Effects**: Use the particle system in `SpawnParticles()`
3. **Camera Modes**: Extend `ViewMode` enum and add implementation in `camera.c`
4. **Game Modes**: Add new game states and update logic in `UpdateGame()`

### Debug Mode
Build with debug symbols and enable debug displays:
```bash
make debug
# In game: Press I to show debug info
```
